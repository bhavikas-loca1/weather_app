# VVeatherly App
<p>
VVeatherly is a simple, minimilistic and aesthetic cross-platform Flutter weather application that provides real-time weather information, UV index, and a chatbot interface for weather queries. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap One Call 3.0 API and supports both light and dark themes. 
This app was originally a figma idea that was then brought to life using flutter.
